# Manuscript → Deployable Slice: Brain-based Risk Stratification (HYDRA) + Explainable Baselines

**DUA-safe, production-respectful** packaging of my MSc manuscript:

- HYDRA-style subtyping (synthetic demo only)
- Explainable baselines on FreeSurfer-like features
- Reproducible runs (Makefile, seeds, tests)

> ⚠️ **Compliance:** No ABCD subject-level data or artifacts. Synthetic/demo only.

## Quickstart
```bash
make setup
```
