## Figure 4 — Regional Neuroimaging Signatures of PH+ Subtypes vs PH−
- **Filename:** `figure4_brain_signatures.png`
- **Caption:** Each column contrasts one subtype of individuals positive for parental mental illness (PH+) to offspring of healthy parents (PH-) using covariate-adjusted standardized mean differences (Cohen’s d) controlling the false-discovery rate (q < 0.05). Rows display, from top to bottom: cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (CSA), subcortical volume (SV), cortical gray–white matter contrast (GWC), cortical neurite density (C-ND) and subcortical neurite density (S-ND). Colour bars show the d range plotted for each metric. Red shades indicate higher values and blue shades lower values in each PH+ subtype compared with PH- offspring; parcels or nuclei in white did not differ significantly. Cortical data are rendered on inflated surfaces based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas; subcortical maps are shown on a coronal slice of the aseg atlas.

## Figure 5 — CBCL Trajectories by HYDRA Subtype
- **Filename:** `figure5_cbcl_trajectories.png`
- **Caption:** Stacked bar charts depict the percentage of participants classified as “Worsened” (red), “No Change” (gray), or “Improved” (blue) in (A) CBCL Internalizing and (B) CBCL Externalizing T-scores from baseline to three-year follow-up. Bars are shown for youth without parental psychiatric history (PH– controls) and for each PH+ HYDRA-defined subtype.

## Synthetic Placeholder — Bootstrap Stability (ARI)
- **Filename:** `fig_stability_ari.png`
- **Caption:** Synthetic placeholder showing mean ± SD ARI across K=2–4. Illustrative only; replaced by pipeline outputs during `make demo_stratify`.

## Synthetic Placeholder — Feature Importance (SHAP/Permutation)
- **Filename:** `fig_shap_top10.png`
- **Caption:** Synthetic placeholder ranking 10 ROI-like features by importance. Illustrative only; replaced by pipeline outputs during `make demo_baselines`.
